# DN2A #


> Digital Neural Network Architecture

DN2A is a set of highly decoupled JavaScript modules for Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence development.

You can use just one module as well as the complete set.

An additional helper module is available for those that want a smooth experience without having to go through the details of each module.

With DN2A you can create and train simple Neural Networks as well as very powerful chain of "minds" through which better abstract your dataset(s) and then the capacity of your whole Artificial Intelligence system. Moreover DN2A allows to represent/export the networks and the relative data as combinable string strains that can be used for working with genetics techniques.

# System Modules #

## Node (Neuron) ##
Module able to facilitate the representation of the data structure around Neurons and to hold relative common functionalities.

## Link (Synapse) ##
Module able to facilitate the representation of the data structure around Synapses and to hold relative common functionalities.

## Network ##
Module, available in different variations, able to use Nodes and Links to implement configurable and autonomous Neural Networks.

## Host (Cerebrum) ##
Module for the management of multiple Neural Networks in terms of intercommunication, chained training/querying and parallel computing through Web Workers.

## Bios (Brain) ##
Module for the normalization of data, interconnection with other external software, communication betweeen installations and monitoring of the whole architecture.
